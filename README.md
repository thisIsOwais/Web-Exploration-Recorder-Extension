# Web Exploration Recorder

Web Exploration Recorder is a Chrome extension paired with a Node.js backend that captures and records web browsing activities. It captures the sequence of URLs you hover over while exploring web pages and records these interactions as rr web events. These events can then be displayed on a video player using the extension.

### Demo

## Features

- **Real-time URL Capture**: Records the sequence of URLs hovered over during browsing.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Ensures real-time communication between the Chrome extension and the Node.js backend.
- **RR Web Events**: Captures interactions as rr web events for accurate replay.
- **Video Playback**: Displays captured interactions as a video through the extension.

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    cd web-exploration-recorder/backend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh

## Usage

1. Make sure the backend server is running (`npm start` in the `backend` directory).

2. Open the Chrome browser and activate the Web Exploration Recorder extension.

3. Browse the web and hover over URLs as needed. The extension will capture these interactions and send them to the backend via WebSocket.

4. To view the recorded video, access the video player through the extension's UI.
